# HVZ-Feed-Card-Generator
A program that generates feed cards for Claremont HVZ with a feed code and its corresponding feeding URL.

The goal of this program is to let a user create feed cards with as little hassle as possible. 

Once the zip file is downloaded, point your favorite command line or terminal address to where you saved it. Just run "python QRfeedcards.py" and it will prompt you with three questions:

1. How many feed cards would you like to create? [Integer]
Type the number of cards you would like to generate. A multiple of 10 is best, since each sheet of paper is designed to print 10 front and back cards. A good number I use is 1000 to cover a whole semester's game. 
Please note that this will also generate the input number of QR codes images as well. 1000 cards means 1000 images. Do not be alarmed.

2. What semester, Fall [F] or Spring [S]?
Just type either the letter "f" or "s" since typing anything longer than that will not fit on the card.

3. What year? [Last two digits]
For example, if it's 2015 only type "15". 

Once the program runs to completion, you will have an excel file that is almost ready to go. Open the file, save as a .PDF, and print to your heart's desires. 

For best results, I recommend buying 2" x 3.5" perforated edge business cards for printing (easy to find at Target). 

May you always have brans.
